## System‑Generated README (for reference)

### React + Vite  

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh  
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh  

---

### React Compiler  

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performance.  
To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).  

---

### Expanding the ESLint Configuration  

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled.  
Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
